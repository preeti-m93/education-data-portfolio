# Gender disparities in school completion (UNESCO API)
This project explores gender-based disparities in school completion rates across India, Nepal and Bangladesh using the UNESCO UIS API. 
I used R to fetch, clean and visualize primary and lower secondary completion rates by gender. 
The goal was to explore insights based on data to better understand where significant gaps still exist and where progress has already been achieved.

## Research questions

- How do school completion rates vary by gender across India, Nepal and Bangladesh?
- Which country has shown the most progress in closing the gender gap at primary and lower secondary levels?

---

## Tools used

- R (httr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2)
- UNESCO UIS API
- RMarkdown

---

## Key visualizations

- Gender-wise completion rates in primary education
- Disparities in lower secondary education

---

## Results 

- Nepal has effectively closed the gender gap in primary education.
- Bangladesh shows persistent gender disparities at the lower secondary level.

## Files

- `code.R`: Main R script to call the API and generate visualizations  
- `report.md`: Writeup  
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing exported plots

## What i learned

- How to work with APIs in R using `httr`
- Reproducible data workflows using `tidyverse`
- Turning raw data into insight-rich visual stories for equity-driven impact
