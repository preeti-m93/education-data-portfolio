# Education data porfolio

Hey there, I’m Preeti Manchanda. I work as an education researcher & analyst and I’m currently building my expertise in psychometrics.
This portfolio highlights selected projects that reflect my experience in using data science to explore important issues in education.

These projects demonstrate my work in:

- Cleaning and working with large-scale survey data
- Analyzing and visualizing data using R
- Studying educational equity, with a focus on gender gaps

## Projects

# 1. Gender disparities in school completion (UNESCO API)
In this project, I used R and the UNESCO API to extract data on school completion rates by gender in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. I visualized the results to highlight where gender gaps remain and where progress has been made.

# 2. Hierarchical and mixed-effects models in R
In real-world education data, students are grouped/nested in classrooms and schools. 
Analyzing this data with simple linear modeling can lead to misleading conclusions because students within the same group aren’t independent. In this project, I conducted hierarchical (multi-level) modeling in R, using a simulated dataset.
